# Install

```bash
# Install from npm

npm install -S hg-plus
```

To use the gitify function, you must also have python2.7.x, git as well as the shipped gitifyhg python addon installed.

To install the addon simply run: 

```bash
cd node_modules/hg-plus/utils/gitifyhg/
python2.7 setup.py install
```
	
Note this feature currently has mixed results on windows. Working on fixing that functionality for the next release.

# Usage

### Basic 

```javascript
// Initialize with default python path ('python')
const Hg = require('hg-plus')();

// Clone a repo using only the url string
let repo = await Hg.clone('http://hostname.com/my/repository/url')
	
await repo.add()
await repo.commit('my example commit')
await repo.push({ password: 'myPassword', username: 'username' })
```

### Create and push a repository

```javascript
const Hg = require('hg-plus')();

let to = { 
	url: 'http://hostname.com/my/repository/url', 
	username: 'me@host.com', 
	password: 'secret'
}

let repo = await Hg.create(to);

await repo.push()

```

### Cloning from multiple repositories into a new one

```javascript
const Hg = require('hg-plus')();

let to = { 
	url: 'http://hostname.com/my/repository/url'
}

let from = [
	'http://hostname.com/my/repository/url1', 
	'http://hostname.com/my/repository/url2', 
	'http://hostname.com/my/repository/url3'
]

let repo = await Hg.clone(from, to);

await repo.commit('I just created a repository from three other repositories!')
await repo.push({ 	
	username: 'me@host.com', 
	password: 'secret'
})

```

# Tests 

First make sure to change the global variable in tests/HgRepo called pythonPath to be a valid
path to your python2.7.x installation. Then run:

```javascript
npm test
```

------------------
- Adding Hg.getRepo, which allows users to get an HgRepo instance from a existing mecurial repository. [Merge pull request #5 from 52linyuepeng/master](https://github.com/jdalrymple/node-hg-plus/26eaecf4e231a55c1fe1d4634fad3d255d79e1fc)

[1.0.1](https://github.com/jdalrymple/node-hg-plus/commit/510e70a4fff5bec35e2489c5228748e330559c87) (2017-07-26)
------------------
- Removed the .hgtags and hg folders from the gitified repo
- Rename .hgignore to be .gitignore and removing 'syntax*' line from the .gitignore file

[1.0.0](https://github.com/jdalrymple/node-hg-plus/commit/5d54b5e8871c13427f8bf2faaa296576952809c4) (2017-07-25)
------------------
- Cleaned up old promise logic and replaced with async/await
- Removed usless rest param arguments from many of the Hg functions for clarity
- Added Object input to the Hg.Clone function (See API Docs above)
- Cleaned up folder structure
- Fixed the setting of the default url if none is passed in by the user
- Fixed cloning from urls instead of local paths
- Added various callback tests to ensure the callback backwards compatibility is maintained
- Added default state tests for the HgRepo Object
- Removed old dependancies now that Promises are more widely supported
- Standardized the callback support to return in the form callback(error, results) always

NOTE: Upgrading from 0.8.0 to 1.0 will break your project. Ensure to add the function call to your require statement - require('hg-plus')()
